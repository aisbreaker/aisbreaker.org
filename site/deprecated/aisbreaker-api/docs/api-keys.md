API Keys (Access Tokens)
========================

API keys are often needed to access API services. They require a registration at the 3rd party service provider and are needed for handling quotas and for billing.

Sometimes, an [AIsBreaker API Key](aisbreaker-api-key.md) is also needed to access an AIsBreaker server and its abstracted AI services - to handle quotas and to use encrypted 3rd party API keys.
