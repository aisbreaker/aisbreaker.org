AIsBreaker Docs
===============

Our Vision
----------
We want to provide a free and open-sourced tool for app developers to access almost any generative AI service in the most easy and most open way.


What is AIsBreaker?
-------------------
AIsBreaker offers a developer-friendly API for streamlined access to a variety of AI services, including the OpenAI/ChatGPT API, Hugging Face AIs, Open Assistant API, and more, all through a consistent and standardized interface. It is a free open-source tool designed to prevent vendor lock-in, ensuring users have the freedom to choose and switch between different service providers without constraints.

Free open-source with MIT license.
