Use Cases
=========

AisBreaker is intermediate API and serves as a powerful bridge between developers and the diverse world of generative AI services, offering flexibility, consistency, and customization options to meet a variety of application needs and business objectives.

Use cases are:
- **Simplified Development**: Developers can save time and effort by utilizing a single, well-documented API to access various AI services, streamlining the development process and reducing the learning curve for each service's unique API.
- **Vendor Agnosticism**: Developers can remain vendor-agnostic and benefit from this API by having the flexibility to switch between different AI service providers without extensive code changes. This is especially valuable **to avoid vendor lock-in**.
- **Cost Efficiency**: The API can facilitate cost management by allowing the selection of different AI services based on pricing, performance, or specific project requirements, thus optimizing cost-efficiency.
- **AI Service Management**: Projects can efficiently manage and monitor their usage of various AI services, gaining insights into performance, usage patterns, and costs through a unified dashboard.
- **Central AI Service Tracing and QA**: Projects can efficiently trace and log the usage of AI services, for QA purposes and to collect trainging data for easier migration to alternative services/vendors.
- **Enhanced Security and Compliance**: It can help in maintaining security and compliance standards as the API can provide a standardized layer for data handling, encryption, and access control across different AI services.
- **Multi-Service Integration**: Developers can use the API to integrate multiple AI services into a single application, combining the capabilities of various providers. For example, combining text generation from one provider with image generation from another for a comprehensive content generation tool.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The API can be used to ensure AI services are accessible and consistent across different platforms, whether it's a mobile app, a web application, or a desktop software.
- **Customization**: Developers can customize and fine-tune the AIsBreaker API by changing or adding connectors or filters to meet the specific needs of their application, tailoring the API to their unique requirements.
- **Performance Optimization**: The API can allow for intelligent load balancing and performance optimization by routing requests to the AI service provider that can deliver the best performance for the task at hand.
- **Scalability**: Businesses can scale their AI capabilities by leveraging the API to easily add or replace AI services as their needs evolve, without major redevelopment.
- **Research and Experimentation**: Developers, researchers and data scientists can use the API to experiment with and compare different AI services, making it easier to prototype and test various algorithms and models.

Only a subset of these use cases is covered by the current implementation. We are working on the others.
