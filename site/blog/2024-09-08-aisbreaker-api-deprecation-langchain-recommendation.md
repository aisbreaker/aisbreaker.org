# AIsBreaker API is Now Deprecated - We Recommend Using LangChain Instead
_By Chris, September 8, 2024_

The AIsBreaker API has long been a developer-friendly tool, offering streamlined access to a variety of AI services through a standardized interface. With no vendor lock-in, it was open-source, licensed under MIT, and free to use.

However, in recent months, we have discovered the powerful [LangChain framework for Python](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/) and its companion, [LangChain.js for TypeScript/JavaScript](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/). While we don't agree with every aspect of these tools, their core functionality far surpasses what AIsBreaker API offered, making them a fantastic upgrade.

As a result, we have decided to stop further development of the AIsBreaker API and officially mark it as **deprecated**.

Stay tuned for more detailed recommendations on how to best utilize LangChain, including what features to embrace and what to approach with caution.

Best regards,
